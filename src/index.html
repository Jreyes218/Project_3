<h1>Project #3: Future Car ideas</h1>

<table width="100%" border="1">
<tr align="left"><th>Make & Model</th><th>Year</th><th>Reason</th></tr>
<tr><td>Chevy Malibu</td><td>2018</td><td>Its small and economic. For sentimantal reasons, I once had one and it was the best car I ever had.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Nissan Maxima</td><td>2018</td><td>I currently have the 2001 version and it is a very reliable car. It takes a beating and keeps on moving. Not too sure about the newer models but I'm willing to give one a go.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Dodge Charger</td><td>2017</td><td>I had the luxury of diving a rental down in Florida one time without the Hemi engine and I loved it. The roar of the engine made it unique. One of the best decent fast cars I've ever had the priviledge of driving.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Chevy Camaro</td><td>2019</td><td>I just love this car. The design looks so beautiful and the speed...it looks as if its just gliding through the air. Pure beauty.</td></tr>
